What is Shell Scripting for DevOps?
Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks and manage systems more efficiently using a script written in a shell programming language. In the context of DevOps, shell scripting is used to automate repetitive tasks, manage server configurations, deploy applications, monitor systems, and much more. Shell scripts can execute commands, manipulate files, and interact with system processes.

Examples:
Automating Backups: A shell script can be written to automatically back up important files and databases at regular intervals.

tar -czvf /backup/myproject-$(date +%F).tar.gz /path/to/project

Deploying Applications: Automate the deployment of an application by pulling the latest code from a repository, installing dependencies, and starting the application.

#!/bin/bash
git pull origin main
npm install
pm2 restart myapp

What is #!/bin/bash? Can we write #!/bin/sh as well?
#!/bin/bash is known as a shebang. It tells the system that the script should be executed using the Bash shell. Similarly, #!/bin/sh tells the system to use the /bin/sh shell, which is often a symbolic link to a shell like Bash or Dash.

While #!/bin/bash explicitly specifies the Bash shell, #!/bin/sh is more generic and might point to different shells on different systems. Using #!/bin/bash ensures that Bash-specific features are available, while #!/bin/sh aims for broader compatibility.


#!/bin/bash
echo "I will complete #90DaysOfDevOps challenge"
Shell Script to Take User Input and Arguments

#!/bin/bash
# Taking user input
echo "Enter your name:"
read userName

# Taking input from arguments
arg1=$1
arg2=$2

# Printing the variables
echo "User input: $userName"
echo "First argument: $arg1"
echo "Second argument: $arg2"
Example of If-Else in Shell Scripting by Comparing Two Numbers
sh

#!/bin/bash

# Define two numbers
num1=10
num2=20

# Compare the numbers
if [ $num1 -gt $num2 ]; then
    echo "$num1 is greater than $num2"
elif [ $num1 -lt $num2 ]; then
    echo "$num1 is less than $num2"
else
    echo "$num1 is equal to $num2"
